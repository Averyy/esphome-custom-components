6.	Installation and Detection Range

Mount on top of the tank or barrel, perpendicular to the liquid or material surface
Avoid installation above feed inlets
Maintain a minimum safe distance of 1/5 of the maximum detection distance from walls
Avoid obstructions within the ±12° beam range

7.	Mechanical Dimensions

Size: 44 mm × 36 mm
PCB Thickness: 2 mm ±10%

8.	Installation Guidelines

8.1 Sensor Housing
The housing must have good wave transmission characteristics at 24 GHz and must not contain metal or other materials that shield electromagnetic waves.

8.2 Environment Considerations
Avoid large reflective surfaces or moving objects in the sensing area
Ensure the sensor is securely mounted to prevent false readings
If multiple 24 GHz radars are used, avoid direct beam alignment

8.3 Power Supply Considerations
Input Voltage: 3.0V - 3.6V
Ensure a low-ripple power source with no significant spectrum peak above 2 MHz

9.	Precautions

9.1 Detection Range
The HLK-LD2413 has a detection range of 0.15 m to 10 m and reports the straight-line distance to the target.

9.2 Baud Rate
115200 bps (default).

9.3 Accuracy
±3 mm under optimal conditions
Accuracy may degrade if:
The target moves or shifts distance
Strong scatterers are nearby

9.4 Response Time
The response time is determined by the reporting period. For example, if the reporting period is set to 160 ms, the response time is approximately 2.4 seconds.

9.5 Threshold Update
Required after sensor installation or housing change.

9.6 Reporting Cycle and Power Consumption

Reporting Period and Average Current:
50 ms - 40 mA
160 ms (default) - 23 mA
1 sec - 16 mA

9.7 Reporting Cycle Behavior
If using real-time waveform display, the actual reporting cycle may be longer, and power consumption will increase.
